# Resume Screening & Job Recommendation System

This project uses Machine Learning and NLP techniques to analyze resumes
and recommend suitable job roles based on skill similarity.

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLP (TF-IDF)
- Pandas

---

## Features
- Resume text preprocessing
- Skill extraction using NLP
- Job role recommendation using ML similarity
- Simple and modular code structure

---

## How It Works
1. Resume text is cleaned and preprocessed
2. TF-IDF converts text into numerical features
3. Similarity is calculated with job role descriptions
4. Best-matching job roles are recommended

---

## How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py

---

## Notes
- Built for learning and demonstration purposes
- Dataset size kept small intentionally
